# Requirements

MadelineProto needs the xml extension to function properly (if not, you will get DOMDocument errors).
MadelineProto uses the gmp, PrimeModule extensions (if not, it will be VERY slow).


Usually these extension is installed by default, [skip to next section](#installation).


If not, here's how to install everything on:

* [Ubuntu](UBUNTU_INSTALLATION.md)
* [Ubuntu (full)](UBUNTU_INSTALLATION_FULL.md)
